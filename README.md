RetroDepot MK1 Protoboard

This is one of the first protoboards that I designed.  I've included it here because it is still useful for small projects, and has a few options for connections.  This board technically predates the RetroDepot website.  However, it was used in some of the earlier projects that were shown on the site, such as the clone of Grant Searle's Z80 that I built.
